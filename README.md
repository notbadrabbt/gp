# gp.ps1

This PowerShell script is designed to kill GlobalProtect by stopping its associated process and service and then starting them again, when you are ready. 

It is intended to be used to restart a stuck client, since there is no way to do it via the agent.

## Features:
- **Stops the GlobalProtect process and service:**  
  Terminates the `pangpa` process and stops the `PanGPS` service.
- **Restarts GlobalProtect:**  
  After a short delay, the script starts the GlobalProtect service and launches the GlobalProtect client executable.
- **Admin Privilege Check:**  
  Automatically checks for administrator rights and attempts to elevate privileges if necessary.
- **Interactive and Automatic Modes:**  
  Use the `-restart` switch for an automatic restart (with a 5-second delay) or run without it for a manual prompt <`ENTER`> to restart GlobalProtect when ready.

## Prerequisites:
- **PowerShell:**  
  This script requires PowerShell to run.
- **Administrator Rights:**  
  Since the script manages services and processes, it must be run with administrative privileges.
- **GlobalProtect Installation:**  
  The script assumes GlobalProtect is installed in the default location:  
  `C:\Program Files\Palo Alto Networks\GlobalProtect\PanGPA.exe`

## Usage:
### Automatic Restart
To automatically restart GlobalProtect after a 5-second delay: `.\gp.ps1 -restart`
### Interactive Mode:
To stop GlobalProtect and wait for user input before restarting: `.\gp.ps1
### Displaying Help:
For help information at runtime: `.\gp.ps1 -help
Alternatively, you can use PowerShellâ€™s built-in help system: `Get-Help .\gp.ps1 -Detailed
### Logging:
All actions are logged to: C:\Temp\Logs\gp_log.txt
